A loop is a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions 
until a specific condition is met. Loops allow you to repeat a process 
over and over without having to write the same (potentially long) 
instructions each time you want your program to perform a task.
There are five types of loops in JavaScript.

1- for loop
2- while loop
3- do-while loop
4- for (..in) loop
5- for (..of) loop

1- JavaScript For loop
The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of 
times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of 
for loop is given below.
for (initialization; condition; increment)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

Example-
for (i=1; i<=5; i++)  
{  
document.write(i + "<br/>")  
}  

2- JavaScript while loop
The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number 
of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known. The 
syntax of while loop is given below.
while (condition)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

Example-
let i=11;  
while (i<=15)  
{  
document.write(i + "<br/>");  
i++;  
} 

3- JavaScript do while loop
The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false. The syntax of do while loop is given below.

do{  
    code to be executed  
}while (condition);  

Example-
let i=21;  
do{  
document.write(i + "<br/>");  
i++;  
}while (i<=25);  

4-for (..in) loop: The JavaScript for (..in) statement loops through the 
enumerable properties of an object. The loop will iterate over all 
enumerable properties of the object itself and those the object inherits 
from its constructorâ€™s prototype.
Syntax
for (variable in object)
  statement

Example-
let userId = ""; 
let i; 
for (i in person) { 
    userId += person[i]; 
} 

5-for (..of) loop: This for (..of) statement lets you loop over the data 
structures that are iterable such as Arrays, Strings, Maps, Node Lists, 
and more. It calls a custom iteration hook with instructions to execute 
on the value of each property of the object.
Syntax
for (variable of iterable) {
  statement
}

Example-
let userId = ""; 
let i; 
for (i of text) { 
    userId += i; 
}
